# The Utah Loop

In general, seeing the parks at sunrise or at night when the stars are out is spectacular.  Getting water in the National Parks may be time consuming, so stock up on water when in town.

Apps like iOverlander and FreeRoam can help find free BLM campgrounds, free dispersed camping or low fee National Forest camping.

## Arches National Park

Camping in Arches is limited, so you can camp for free on BLM land north of Arches off Hwy 191. Or at the end of the day in Arches you could drive towards Canyonlands off Hwy 313 at Horsetheif Campground.

### Devil's Garden Trail (Landscape Arch Trail)

This trail can be an out and back or a loop (depending on conditions). Landscape Arch is incredible; there are also several other arches and viewpoints on this trail. The trail is easy to Landscape Arch, but then becomes more sketchy past that if there is snow or ice.

Landscape Arch is at the end of the park's road so be sure to stop at lookouts and interesting short trails along the way.

### Delicate Arch at Night

Delicate Arch is one of the most popular trails, but if you get a weather window, hike to Delicate Arch at night when the stars are out. At the beginning there is a well defined trail and then becomes a trek up a large sloping rock mound all the way up to Delicate Arch. The landscape is other-worldly at night and you can see quite far. Be sure to get a good sense of the direction you'll be heading up to the Arch so you can get back safely in case weather comes in. There are cliffs if you venture to far to the sides of the large rock mound leading up to Delicate Arch. Bring a compass and map.

### Fiery Furnace Viewpoint and Permit Area

We did not get to explore this area, but it's next on my list. You can either go on a ranger-led hike or get a permit to explore on your own. See [Fiery Furnace Viewpoint and Permit Area](https://www.nps.gov/places/fiery-furnace-viewpoint.htm)

## Canyonlands National Park (Island in the Sky)

There are a few areas of Canyonlands, but the one closest to Arches is called Island in the Sky. The Needles is another area you may be interested to look into because there are several 4x4 roads to explore, however it may be too time consuming to get to the Needles area. We've only been to Island in the Sky

### Shafer Trail Road

We haven't got a chance to do this road, but it's next on the list. See [Experience the Shafer Trail](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/experience-the-shafer-trail.htm)

### Upheaval Dome

A really strange geological feature worth checking out. See [Upheaval Dome](https://www.nps.gov/articles/cany-upheaval-dome.htm)
