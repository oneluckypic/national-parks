# The Utah Loop

Since you'll be going in Late March and we went in early January you can probably ignore my warnings about snow/ice, but if it's colder than usual, they could be useful.

In general, seeing the parks at sunrise or at night when the stars are out is spectacular. Bring snow chains since they may not let you past the park gates without them on. If there is snow/ice on the trails getting some Yak Traks or similar is useful. The snow usually doesn't get too deep so snow shoes are probably not needed (but of course it depends).

One challenge you may have is getting water at campgrounds. They may close the water spouts during winter or they may freeze even if they are open. Pick up some water in town.

### Devil's Garden Trail (Landscape Arch Trail)

This trail can be an out and back or a loop (depending on conditions). Landscape Arch is incredible and this trail is beautiful in the snow. There are also several other arches and viewpoints on this trail. The trail is easy to Landscape Arch, but then becomes more sketchy past that if there is snow and ice.

Landscape Arch is at the end of the park's road so be sure to stop at lookouts and interesting short trails along the way.

### Delicate Arch at Night

Delicate Arch is one of the most popular trails, but if you get a weather window, hike to Delicate Arch at night when the stars are out. At the beginning there is a well defined trail and then becomes a trek up a large sloping rock mound all the way up to Delicate Arch. The landscape is other-worldly at night and you can see quite far. Be sure to get a good sense of the direction you'll be heading up to the Arch so you can get back safely in case weather comes in. There are cliffs if you venture to far to the sides of the large rock mound leading up to Delicate Arch. Bring a compass and map

### Fiery Furnace Viewpoint and Permit Area

We did not get to explore this area, but it's next on my list. You can either go on a ranger-led hike or get a permit to explore on your own. See [Fiery Furnace Viewpoint and Permit Area](https://www.nps.gov/places/fiery-furnace-viewpoint.htm)
